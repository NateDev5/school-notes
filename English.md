## Themes in "Sonny's blues"
**Attentive listening**: When a listener "make sense" out of something they just heard, they are actually making sense out of it - listening is a co-creative, collaborative process. It requires presence/attention. It activates imagination and memory. Its a choice. 

**Jazz**: knows the rules but breaks them. Leaves spaces for individual voices and experiences. Its democratic, collkective form where each participant is valued.

**Jazz literature**: Jazz like rhythm, feel of improvisation, repetition, idea of a "solo", breaking/playing with tradition. Culturally specific diction/syntax

**The blues**: music that originate in the deep south of th US. call and response pattern.
