**Broadband**: many signals
**Baseband**: one signal

**Backbone**: has to be fast, has to be redundant (connect all physical servers together) (baseband)

**COAX Cable (RG-6 connector of COAX cable)**: easy to work with, can carry a lot of data

*Impedance, Capacitance and Inductance (not important for test)*

**Twisted pair**:
- Stranded: for flexibility 
- Solid: permanent
- Shielded
- Unshielded

**Crosstalk**: Cable interference that can degrade the signal if crosstalk between two cables (without proper shielding data can be intercepted)

**EMI (Electromagnetic interference) = Crosstalk**

**Hertz**: one hertz = one time per second

**Twisted pair stats** (Has 4 pairs of cable): 
- Irrelevant: Cat 1-4
- Relevant: Cat 5-6a
- Cat 5: 100 mbps
- Cat 5e: 1000 mbps
- Cat 6: 10000 (2500, 5000) mbps
- Cat 6a: 10000 mbps
*MHz not needed to remember for the quiz but it is for the test.
Need to know Mbps for each cable*
RJ11: Telephone
**RJ45**: Ethernet

**Fiber-optic**: Glass (uses laser), fragile
- MMF (Multimod fiber, cheaper) (Has one connector that handles input, output): LED
- SMF (Single mod fiber) (Has two connectors one for input, one for output): Laser

	 Type of signal (Baseband, broadband)

T = Twisted pair
FX = Fiber optic

100BaseT = Cat 5
100BaseFX = Fiber optic MMF

**Connector types**:
- LC (fiber optic with two channels) = SMF
- SC (fiber optic with one channel) = MMF
